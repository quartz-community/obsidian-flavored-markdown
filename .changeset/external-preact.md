"@quartz-community/obsidian-flavored-markdown": patch
---

Uses Quartz's own `preact` instead of bundling a second copy (`noExternal` in the build overrode the externals). Components now share one Preact instance with Quartz and other plugins, so hooks and context work across them, and the bundle is smaller.
